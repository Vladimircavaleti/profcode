        I'm scared (whoa-oh) <br>
        It feels like you don't care (whoa-oh) <br>
        Enlighten me, my dear (whoa-oh) <br>
        Why am I still here? (Whoa-oh) <br>
        <br>
        I don't mean to be complacent with the decisions you made <br>
        But why? <br>

        In the back of my mind (whoa-oh), you died (whoa-oh) <br>
        And I didn't even cry (whoa-oh), no, not a single tear <br>
        And I'm sick of waiting patiently (ooh-ooh) <br>
        For someone that won't even arrive <br>
        <br>
        Whoa, whoa, whoa <br>
        Whoa, whoa <br>
        <br>

        In the back of my mind, I killed you <br>
        And I didn't even regret it, I can't believe I said it <br>
        But it's true <br>
        Do I love you? No, I hate you <br>
        <br>
        In the back of my mind (whoa-oh) <br>
        You died (whoa-oh) <br>
        And I didn't even cry (whoa-oh, whoa-oh) <br>
        Not a single tear <br>
        <br>
        Whoa, whoa, whoa <br>
        Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, oh <br>
         <br>

        I killed you and I didn't even regret it <br>
        I can't believe I said it, but it's true <br>
        I love (whoa), I love (whoa), I love (whoa) <br>
        <br>

        Thank you, Phoenix, I love y'all so much <br>
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh  <br>

        Thought I found a way <br>
        Thought I found a way out (found) <br>
        But you never go away (never go away) <br>
        So I guess I gotta stay now <br>
        <br>
        Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here <br>
        Even if it takes all night or a hundred years <br>
        Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near <br>
        Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear <br>
        <br>
        Isn't it lovely, all alone? <br>
        Heart made of glass, my mind of stone <br>
        Tear me to pieces, skin to bone <br>
        Hello, welcome home <br>
        <br>
        Walkin' out of time <br>
        Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place) <br>
        Something's on my mind (mind) <br>
        Always in my head space <br>
        <br>
        But I know some day I'll make it out of here <br>
        Even if it takes all night or a hundred years <br>
        Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near <br>
        Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear <br>
        <br>
        Isn't it lovely, all alone? <br>
        Heart made of glass, my mind of stone <br>
        Tear me to pieces, skin to bone <br>
        Hello, welcome home <br>
        <br>
        Whoa, yeah <br>
        Yeah, ah <br>
        Whoa, whoa <br>

            Every time I'm walkin' out <br>
            I can hear you tellin' me to turn around <br>
            Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down <br>
